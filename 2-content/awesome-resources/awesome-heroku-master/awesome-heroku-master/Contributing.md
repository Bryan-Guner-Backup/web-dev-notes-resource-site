# Contributing Guidelines

Make sure your pull request follows these guidelines:

- Search through the previous pull requests before making a new one! 🙏
- Make sure you've personally used or benefited from the suggested resource.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `\`tag\` [Resource Title](url) — description.`
- Expand on why the resource is useful in your pull request if needed.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive. 
- Adding new categories, or improving existing categories is welcome!
- Double check your spelling and grammar! 😁

Here's a list of tags and the order they should be in:

- `official` — anything created by Heroku themselves (eg. docs, blog).
- `article` — a blog article.
- `blog` — an entire blog that writes useful articles often.
- `book` — a book or ebook.
- `plugin` — a plugin for the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).
- `question` — a StackOverflow question.
- `tool` — a developer tool (eg. [dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/), [HireFire](https://www.hirefire.io/)).

Keep entries sorted by tags in that order inside each category, and then alphabetically by the title.

Thanks for contributing!
